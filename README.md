# Sorting Visualiser

Web app made with vanilla JS that ilustrates how popular sorting algorithms work. User can choose an algorithm, generate an array and watch the exact way (seeing the elements that are being compared) how the array is sorted with chosen algorithm. Currently it runs only desktop version, it will be fixed soon.
